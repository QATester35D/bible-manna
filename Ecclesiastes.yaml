Ecclesiastes:
  1:
    1: "¹ The words of the Teacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem: \n"
    2: "² “Meaningless! Meaningless!”\n    says the Teacher.\n“Utterly meaningless!\n\
      \    Everything is meaningless.” \n"
    3: "³ What do people gain from all their labors\n    at which they toil under
      the sun?\n"
    4: "⁴ Generations come and generations go,\n    but the earth remains forever.\n"
    5: "⁵ The sun rises and the sun sets,\n    and hurries back to where it rises.\n"
    6: "⁶ The wind blows to the south\n    and turns to the north;\nround and round
      it goes,\n    ever returning on its course.\n"
    7: "⁷ All streams flow into the sea,\n    yet the sea is never full.\nTo the place
      the streams come from,\n    there they return again.\n"
    8: "⁸ All things are wearisome,\n    more than one can say.\nThe eye never has
      enough of seeing,\n    nor the ear its fill of hearing.\n"
    9: "⁹ What has been will be again,\n    what has been done will be done again;\n\
      \    there is nothing new under the sun.\n"
    10: "¹⁰ Is there anything of which one can say,\n    “Look! This is something
      new”?\nIt was here already, long ago;\n    it was here before our time.\n"
    11: "¹¹ No one remembers the former generations,\n    and even those yet to come\n
      will not be remembered\n    by those who follow them. \n"
    12: '¹² I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. '
    13: '¹³ I applied my mind to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under
      the heavens. What a heavy burden God has laid on mankind! '
    14: "¹⁴ I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are
      meaningless, a chasing after the wind. \n"
    15: "¹⁵ What is crooked cannot be straightened;\n    what is lacking cannot be
      counted. \n"
    16: '¹⁶ I said to myself, “Look, I have increased in wisdom more than anyone who
      has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge.” '
    17: "¹⁷ Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness
      and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind. \n"
    18: "¹⁸ For with much wisdom comes much sorrow;\n    the more knowledge, the more
      grief."
